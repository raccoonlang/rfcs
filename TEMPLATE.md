## Summary

A single-paragraph context-problem-solution summary. The goal is to make the purpose _click_ for the reader. (It's usually best to write this as a final step of writing the RFC.)


## Background

Just enough context necessary to frame the rest of the RFC. The content should be indisputable facts, not opinion.


## Problem

A description of the problem that this RFC is trying to address, the constraints, and why this problem is worth solving now.


## Proposal

What should be added:

- The exact feature you're requesting to add
- A sample code/pseudo-code with the implementation
